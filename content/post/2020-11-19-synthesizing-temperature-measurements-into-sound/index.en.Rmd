## Introduction 

If you're interested in arduino, midi audio or sound synthesis this blog post
might interest you. It will give an overview over the [Chaos
Machine](https://gitlab.com/urswilke/chaos_machine_code) code repository. This
repository is the result of the artist and my friend Axel Crettenand having the
idea of his project called CHOEUR AQUATIQUE (the *Underwater Choir*) and hiring me to develop the code.
